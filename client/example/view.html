<template name="devwikView">
		<div class='row'>



Currently you can only use <strong> simple views </strong> that include the keys from the original tables but they are <a href='http://docs.meteor.com/#reactivity'>reactive.</a></strong> Any chages to the underlying tables is automatically propagated to the view.

			<pre> create view bar as select firstName, lastName, email, jobTitle, employees.officeCode, city, addressLine1, state, country from offices, employees where employees.officeCode = offices.officeCode limit 3; </pre>
works fine. It gives us employee and office info for each employee and includes keys in each table.
Once you create a view in the DB, subject to the above limitations, you use it the same as you would a table. The driver creates the objects server side, and you create a <strong> Table object </strong>  in the client using the view name. 
			<pre> var empCity = new Meteor.Table('empCity'); </pre>
<strong> Updatable views are not supported.</strong>  You can't insert, update or delete from a view.
